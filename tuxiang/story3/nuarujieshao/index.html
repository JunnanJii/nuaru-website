     <p>Sports
 
      In Nauru, Australian rules football and weightlifting are the national sports. Of these, Australian rules football is the most popular and there is an eight-team league. Volleyball, basketball and tennis are also popular sports. Nauru has participated in the Commonwealth Games and the Summer Olympics in Atlanta, USA.
       
      Australian Rules Football
       
      Australian rules football, known simply as Australian football or Australian rugby, dates back to the 1930s when schools in Victoria, Australia, enrolled a number of Nauruan schoolchildren, one of whom was Hammer Deroburt, who left Australia and returned to Nauru with a few friends to first promote the sport in his home state. Australia has the highest national participation rate in rules football in the world at over 30%.
       
      Weightlifting
       
      In 1996, Nauru sent three weightlifters to the Atlanta Olympics for the first time. The first Nauruan female athlete made her official debut in weightlifting at the subsequent Sydney Olympics. Nauru athletes were seen at the three Summer Olympic Games in 1996, 2000 and 2004, mostly in weightlifting, and President Marcus Stven was a medallist, having entered Parliament in 2003 and being elected President in 2007.
       
      Rugby
       
      Rugby has also become very popular in Nauru in recent years. Nauru has its own rugby team, the Nauru National Rugby Union team (sevens), and participated in the New Zealand International Rugby Sevens tournament in New Zealand in 2015.</p>
