     <p>Over the years, countless seabirds have come to inhabit the island, leaving behind a huge amount of guano which, over the years, has chemically changed into a 10-metre thick layer of high quality fertiliser, known as a 'phosphate mine'. Three fifths of the island is covered in phosphate, with only a narrow strip of flat land along the coast.
      Phosphate is abundant and exports to Australia and New Zealand are Nauru's main source of income. A huge metal cantilever has been built on the west side of the island so that phosphate mined on the island can be loaded directly onto ships moored on the reef.</p>
