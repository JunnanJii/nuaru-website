     <h3>Nauru, known as The Republic of Nauru, takes its name from the Nauruan word 'Anáoero', which means 'I go to the beach'. The original inhabitants of Nauru were fed by aquaculture in the Buada Lagoon, and in 1798 Nauru was visited by the first Westerner, Captain John Fearn of the British whaling ship Hunter, who saw the island's waters. When Germany occupied the island in 1888, the name "Pleasant Island" was dropped and the name "Nauru" was restored. After the German occupation in 1888, the name "Pleasant Island" was dropped and the name "Nauru" was restored.</h3>
     <h3>Nauru is located in the central Pacific Ocean, about 41 km from the equator to the north, 4160 km from the island of Hawaii to the northeast, 306 km from Kiribati to the east and 4000 km from Sydney, Australia across the Solomon Islands to the southwest. The nearest island is Barnabas (part of Kiribati), 300 km apart. The entire island of Nauru is 6 km long and 4 km wide, with a coastline of approximately 30 km, a total area of approximately 21 km2, an exclusive economic zone of 320,000 km2 and a population of approximately 110,000, including approximately 10,000 non-Nauruans. Nauru is the smallest country in the South Pacific and the third smallest country in the world, after the Vatican and Monaco.</h3>

      <h3>Nauru is an oval-shaped coral island surrounded by a coral reef which is revealed at low tide. The presence of the reef prevents the establishment of a harbour and therefore only small boats can access Nauru. Nauru's central plateau is surrounded by coral cliffs, the highest point of which is called The Command Ridge at 71 metres above sea level. Nauru has no rivers and the only lake, Buada Lagoon, is also brackish. Although there is a lot of precipitation, the island's surface is very permeable and there is little fresh water on the island, which is collected in small quantities by the inhabitants through water harvesting devices.</h3>  
        
        <h3>Nauru has a tropical rainforest climate, close to the equator, with high temperatures and rainfall throughout the year, with an average annual rainfall of 1,500 mm and average annual temperatures ranging from 24°C to 38°C. Nauru is subject to monsoons from November to February each year, but usually without cyclones.</h3>
        
        <h3>Nauru is one of the three largest phosphate islands in the Pacific Ocean, and over the years the seabirds that have inhabited the island have left behind a large amount of guano, which has been chemically altered over the years to form a 'phosphate layer' up to 10 metres thick. Three fifths of the island's total area is covered in phosphate, with only a narrow strip of flat land along the coast. At present, most of Nauru's phosphate mines have been depleted. The central plateau has also been depleted by phosphate mining, creating barren terrain with jagged limestone spires up to 15 metres high. Mining has destroyed approximately 80% of Nauru's land and has also affected the surrounding Exclusive Economic Zone, with approximately 40% of marine life killed by silt and phosphate runoff.</h3>
        
       <h3>Location-wise, Nauru is in the middle of three major island groups in the Pacific (Micronesian, Melanesian and Polynesian) and is part of the Micronesian Island Group, and the indigenous people who have lived on Nauru for generations are actually descendants of intermarried Micronesians, Melanesians and Polynesians from the three island groups. Fifty-eight per cent of Nauru's population are Nauruans who, like many tropical islanders, live a life of recreation, fishing and hunting birds and gathering fruit for food; 26 per cent are other Pacific Islanders; 8 per cent are Europeans; and 8 per cent are Chinese.</h3> 
        
       <h3>The majority of Nauru's inhabitants are Christian, with 2/3 Protestant and 1/3 Roman Catholic. In addition, approximately 10% are Baha'i, the highest proportion in the world; 9% are Buddhist; and 2.2% are Muslim. Nauru's Constitution provides for freedom of worship for its residents.</h3> 
        
       <h3>Nauru is divided into 14 administrative districts, divided into 8 electoral districts. The most populous area is the Denigomodu District with 1,804 inhabitants. Nauru has no official capital and the government offices are located in the Aaron District.</h3>

         <h3>Nauru is the third-smallest country in the world behind Vatican City and Monaco, making it the smallest republic as well as the smallest island nation. Its population of about IOOO is the world's second-smallest (not including colonies or overseas territories), after Vatican City.
         Nauru is a phosphate-rock island with rich deposits near the surface, which allowed easy strip mining operations for over a century.

         <h5>Nauru is one of the three major phosphate islands in the Pacific Ocean, and over the years the seabirds that have inhabited the islands have left behind a huge amount of guano, which has been chemically altered over the years to form a 'phosphate layer' up to IO metres thick.</h5>
         <h6>Due to the depletion of phosphate reserves and the environmental degradation caused by mining, coupled with the shrinking of the island-wide wealth fund, the Nauru government has resorted to a number of alternative methods of generating revenue. In order to generate revenue, Nauru became a tax haven and a centre for illegal money laundering, with Nauruans investing much of the revenue generated from mining in foreign real estate. Nauru receives assistance from the Australian government and in return has built a detention centre to deal with refugees who have entered Australia illegally.
